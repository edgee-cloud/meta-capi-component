Meta Conversions API is designed to create a connection between an advertiserâ€™s marketing data (such as website events) and Meta systems that optimize ad targeting, decrease cost per result and measure outcomes.
Each event you send to Meta CAPI must have a user property (at least one of the following: email, phone_number), otherwise the event will be ignored.
