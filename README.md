This component implements the data collection protocol between [Meta CAPI](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/conversions-api/) and [Edgee](https://www.edgee.cloud).

### Event mapping:

Here is the mapping between Edgee events and GA events:

| Edgee event | GA Event  |
|-------------|-----------|
| Page   | `PageView`     |
| Track  | Name of the event |
| User   | `Lead` |

Each time you make a `user` call, Edgee will send an `Lead` event to Meta CAPI.

But when you make a `user` call using Edgee's JS library or Data Layer, the `user_id`, `anonymous_id` and `properties` are stored in the user's device.
This allows the user's data to be added to any subsequent page or follow-up calls for the user, so that you can correctly attribute these actions.

**BE CAREFUL:**
Meta Conversions API is designed to create a connection between an advertiserâ€™s marketing data (such as website events) and Meta systems that optimize ad targeting, decrease cost per result and measure outcomes.
Each event you send to Meta CAPI must have a user property (at least one of the following: `email`, `phone_number`), otherwise the event will be ignored.

Here is an example of a user call:
```javascript
edgee.user({
  user_id: "123",
  properties: {
    email: "john.doe@example.com",
  },
});
```

## Usage

- Download the latest version in our [releases page](../../releases). 
- Place the wasm file in a known place in your server (e.g. `/var/edgee/components`).
- Update your edgee proxy config:
```toml
[[destinations.data_collection]]
name = "meta_capi"
component = "/var/edgee/components/meta_capi.wasm"
credentials.meta_access_token = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
credentials.meta_pixel_id = "YOUR_PIXEL_ID"
credentials.meta_test_event_code = "TEST_EVENT_CODE" # Optional
```

To know how to get the access token and pixel id, please refer to the [Meta CAPI documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/conversions-api/get-started).

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities
If you've found a vulnerability or potential vulnerability in our code, please let us know at
[edgee-security](mailto:security@edgee.cloud).

## Building from source

To build the wasm file from source, you need to have installed 
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- `wasm32-wasip2` target: run `rustup target add wasm32-wasip2`
- `wasm-tools`: run `cargo install --locked wasm-tools`

Then you can run the following commands:

```bash
make build
```
